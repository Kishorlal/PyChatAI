## Scenario 2
Verify Open AI GPT model has the capability to recollect data from its memory after session is closed, after adding memory component

## Scenario 3
Improve/optimize memory upon :
1: User request to recollect data within a specific datetime range
2: User request to save the data to memory at the end of session. This helps to save memory if the user is just trying to recall any previous conversation in such cases conversation need not be saved.
3: Saving conversation at end of session without exit request and response of exit request.
